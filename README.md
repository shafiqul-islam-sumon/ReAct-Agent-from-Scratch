# üß† ReAct Agent from Scratch (No Framework)

This project walks you through building a **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) AI Agent** entirely from scratch in Python, **without using LangChain, LlamaIndex, or any external framework**. The result is a fully customizable and transparent system capable of complex reasoning and tool use, wrapped in a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.

---

## üîç Why Build a ReAct Agent from Scratch?

Most AI frameworks abstract away the core reasoning and decision-making logic, which limits your understanding and flexibility. This project is ideal if you want to:

- **Deeply understand** how AI agents think, act, and reason.
- **Customize** every part of your agent, including how it uses tools and handles memory.
- **Learn the inner workings** of ReAct architecture and step-by-step execution.
- **Avoid framework overhead**, allowing better performance and clarity.

By building from scratch, you'll take complete control of your agent's behavior and gain real insight into the reasoning-action-observation loop that powers modern AI agents.

## ü§ñ What is a ReAct AI Agent?

A **ReAct Agent** (short for **Reasoning + Acting**) is a next-gen AI model that doesn‚Äôt just respond with static answers‚Äîit **thinks, takes actions using tools**, and **adapts its response** in real time.

Unlike traditional chatbots that rely on predefined rules or one-shot responses, a ReAct agent dynamically interacts with tools like:

- üßÆ Calculator
- üåê Wikipedia
- üîç Web Search
- üå¶Ô∏è Weather APIs

This allows the agent to **solve multi-step problems**, **correct itself**, and **deliver accurate, up-to-date answers**.

## üí° Why ReAct Is Better Than Traditional AI Agents

| Feature           | Traditional AI Agents          | ReAct AI Agents                         |
|------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Answer retrieval | Direct response                | Step-by-step reasoning                   |
| Decision-making  | Rule-based or limited          | Adaptive and context-aware               |
| Tool usage       | Static, predefined             | Real-time API access via tools           |
| Self-correction  | ‚ùå No                         | ‚úÖ Yes ‚Äì adjusts based on new info       |

> ReAct Agents are ideal for complex reasoning tasks like:  
> _"What‚Äôs the weather in the city where the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics winner was born?"_

A traditional agent fails here, but a ReAct agent:
1. Finds the Nobel winner  
2. Determines their birthplace  
3. Looks up the weather in that location  
4. Returns a refined, complete answer

---
## üîç Inside the ReAct Agent: A Step-by-Step Breakdown

Unlike traditional AI models that return static answers, a **ReAct Agent** follows a structured loop‚Äî**Thought ‚Üí Action ‚Üí PAUSE ‚Üí Observation**‚Äîto reason step by step, interact with external tools, and refine its responses dynamically.

### üîÅ ReAct Loop

![ReAct Loop](images/react_loop.png)


### üß† Thought ‚Äì Reasoning Before Acting

The agent first interprets the user query and plans what to do. It breaks the problem into smaller tasks, decides the right tool, and prepares for action.

> **Example Query:**  
> *"Who discovered gravity, and what‚Äôs the weather where he was born?"*  
> ‚Üí Thought: ‚ÄúFind the scientist ‚Üí Find birthplace ‚Üí Check weather.‚Äù

---

### ‚ö° Action ‚Äì Using Tools

Once the agent decides, it performs an action using a tool like:

- `wikipedia` ‚Äì factual info  
- `web_search` ‚Äì real-time search  
- `weather` ‚Äì live weather data  
- `calculator` ‚Äì math ops

> **Example:**  
> `Action: wikipedia: "Who discovered gravity?"`

---

### ‚è∏Ô∏è PAUSE ‚Äì Wait for Results

After the action, the agent pauses and waits for the result. This ensures it doesn‚Äôt assume or guess and can respond based on real data.

---

### üëÄ Observation ‚Äì React and Refine

The agent receives a result, evaluates it, and decides the next step. It may take another action or move toward a final answer.

> **Observation:** "Isaac Newton discovered gravity."  
> ‚Üí Next Thought: "Where was Newton born?"

---

### üîÑ Full Loop Example

1. **Thought:** Find who discovered gravity  
2. **Action:** `wikipedia: "Who discovered gravity?"`  
3. **Observation:** Isaac Newton  
4. **Thought:** Find Newton‚Äôs birthplace  
5. **Action:** `wikipedia: "Isaac Newton birthplace"`  
6. **Observation:** Woolsthorpe, England  
7. **Thought:** Get weather in Woolsthorpe  
8. **Action:** `weather: "Woolsthorpe"`  
9. **Observation:** "10¬∞C, clear"  
10. **Final Answer:** Newton was born in Woolsthorpe. The current weather is 10¬∞C and clear.

This loop-based approach makes the ReAct Agent **adaptive, intelligent, and capable of solving multi-step queries** with high accuracy and transparency.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture of the ReAct Agent

The ReAct agent is built to think, act, observe, and refine its answers using a loop-driven architecture. It breaks complex problems into steps, leverages external tools, and dynamically updates its reasoning.

---

### üñºÔ∏è System Architecture Overview

![Architecture](images/react_architecture.png)

The architecture consists of six core stages:

1. **User Input & Query Processing**  
2. **Thought Process (Reasoning & Memory)**  
3. **Action Execution (Tool Usage)**  
4. **Environment Interaction (APIs)**  
5. **Observation Loop**  
6. **Final Answer Generation**

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Query Processing

The process starts with the user's question. It can range from basic knowledge to real-time weather or multi-hop queries. The agent first decides whether the answer requires memory, reasoning, or tools.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Thought & Reasoning

ChatGPT acts as the brain. It:

- Understands the query
- Breaks it down logically
- Checks past interactions (memory)
- Plans what to do next

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Memory & Token Management

To handle long conversations, the agent:

- Stores past queries, thoughts, and observations
- Summarizes older messages when hitting token limits
- Keeps the context relevant and concise

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ External Tools (Environment)

The agent interacts with real-world APIs like:

- `Wikipedia` ‚Äì factual knowledge  
- `Web Search` ‚Äì latest info  
- `Weather` ‚Äì live conditions  
- `Calculator` ‚Äì math tasks

It uses the right tool based on what the LLM deems necessary.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Observation & Reasoning Loop

After a tool returns data:

- The agent reviews the result
- Decides if more info is needed
- May repeat the Thought ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Observation cycle

This loop continues until the query is fully answered.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Final Answer Generation

Once all data is collected:

- Results are merged and formatted clearly
- Irrelevant steps are skipped
- A concise, readable final answer is presented

> **Example:**  
> ‚ÄúJohn Smith won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics. He was born in Stockholm. The weather in Stockholm is 12¬∞C, clear skies.‚Äù

This modular architecture makes the ReAct Agent **robust, explainable, and easy to extend**, whether you‚Äôre adding new tools or improving decision logic.

---

### üß∞ Project Structure

## üñ•Ô∏è Creating a Web Interface (Streamlit)

To make the ReAct Agent more accessible and user-friendly, a web interface is built using **Streamlit**. This allows users to interact with the agent in natural language and view its full reasoning process in real time.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Layout of the UI

The web interface is structured into three key sections:

- **üí¨ Main Chat Panel**: Displays the user's query and the agent's final response in a conversational style.
- **üìä Sidebar (Chain of Thought)**: Shows the internal reasoning loop ‚Äî including `Thought`, `Action`, `PAUSE`, `Observation`, and `Final Answer` ‚Äî step by step.
- **‚å®Ô∏è Input Box**: A text field for submitting queries (e.g., "What is the weather in Tokyo?").
